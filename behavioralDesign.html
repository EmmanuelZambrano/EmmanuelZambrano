		<h1>Behavioral Design Focused Application</h1>
		<p>
			This project was part of a Behavioral Design course that was taken during the Fall of 2016. The purpose of this course was to become familiar with a user-centered design process. Behavioral Design principles were applied in the design of an application that allowed users to become better readers.

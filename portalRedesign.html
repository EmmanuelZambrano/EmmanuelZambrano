		<h1>Web Portal Redesign</h1>
		<p>
			This project was part of a Human-Computer Interaction course that was taken during the Spring of 2015. The purpose of this project was to redesign the IIT web portal that is used by students and staff. The project was completed with a team of capable students. The project was split up into different parts. First, a specific behavior had to be chosen that users of the web portal participated in. My team chose to redesign the way users updated their personal information. Next, the current process of updating personal information was analyzed. The redesign was completed by using ideas and theories learned in class.

			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
			I am a Mexican-American. I am enthused about technology that pushes limits.
			Being raised in the south-side of Chicago, I am aware of the many bad things that happen
			in this world. Being Mexican-American, I am aware of the many people who can't make enough
			money, no matter the amount of hours they work. Being a member of the human race, I understand
			that there are many people going through situations that inhibet them from being happy.
			I believe that technology along side wonderful human-beings can make this world a better place.

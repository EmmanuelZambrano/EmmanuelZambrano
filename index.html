		<h3>Jace From the Future</h3>
		<p>
			A blog application was built using Express for a music artist. The application gives the artist the ability to perform CRUD operations with blogs. This project was created for Web Systems Integration at IIT in the fall of 2017. Below are links to the projects GitHub, a Youtube video where I explain the application in more depth, and also a link showcasing the look of the site.

		<h3>Web Portal Redesign</h3>
		<p>
			This project was part of a Human-Computer Interaction course that was taken during the Spring of 2015. The purpose of this project was to redesign the IIT web portal. The project was a collaborative work with other students. The project was split up into different parts. First, a specific behavior had to be chosen. My team chose to redesign the way users update their personal information. Next, the current process of updating personal information was analyzed. The redesign was completed by using ideas and principles learned in class about Human-Computer Interaction.
